                Part I - The Legend of the Fenghuang Phoenix
              </h4>
              <p class="cardChar_text">
                Once upon a time, in the lands colloquially known as the
                far-south, a great disaster had reached the nations of the
                continent.<br /><br />

                It would come every five years, during the months of July and
                August; a great Phoenix would appear in the east and rampage
                through the Lands. Its fury would know no bound, and no reason
                would tame the beast. Every year, the Phoenix would be
                ultimately taken down after a long and gruesome battle; and yet
                every five year the same Phoenix would rise again from the
                ashes.<br /><br />

                After decades of living under the fear of the Phoenix, a Young
                Emperor decided to learn the truth about the beast, and he
                called for the greatest warriors of the Continent to go and slay
                the beast for good.<br /><br />

                Word of the Emperor request would reach many a warrior, most
                would be slain; the others would return burnt, or injured,
                telling of great fire, and an unkillable beast...Yet as hope
                seemed lost, words of hte Emperor request reached the head of
                the Grandmaster of the Taixuan Dojo, located in the great Taixia
                mountain. The Grandmaster ventured alone to battle the monster;
                and returned from its lair forty eight day later. His body was
                charred, his eyes bloodshot...but he had vanquished the beast.
                The grandmaster would venture to the Emperor and announce the
                beast to be slain for good - And indeed, five years later the
                beast did not rise.<br /><br /><br />

                ...Yet, the truth lay elsewhere.<br />
                For in reality, the beast could not be vanquished in spite of
                the might of the Taixuan grandmaster; and to vanquish the beast,
                he was granted no other choice to seal its fiery heart upon his
                very soul.<br /><br />

                But the grandmaster was no fool. He understood well that the
                beast would eventually break free - So, in an attempt to dilute
                the threat of the monster, through an elaborate ritual, he
                transferred part of the phoenix energy to his descendants,
                cursing his bloodline to an eternity of battle against the beast
                that never dies.<br /><br />

                Through the years, the Taixuan grandmasters came and went; some
                became possessed by the fragmented will of the Phoenix; it is in
                one such occurrence that the heirs of the Taixuan were exiled
                after the mountain that was their home for thousands of years
                was destroyed. The Hua dynasty migrated north, and would
                eventually settle in amongrae, and eventually, in Settia.<br /><br />

                As time came and went, Fu hua was born.<br />
              </p>
              <h4 class="cardChar_title">Part II - Fu Hua</h4>
              <p class="cardChar_text">
                As time went on, the Family dojo in Settia had become famous
                enough for its strict admission requirements that many would
                come and learn the strange Taixuan martial arts; whereas the
                leader of the Family became traditionally known as the
                “Empyrean'' as a way to remember their ancient home. In general,
                Fu Hua was born in a peaceful time, there had been no incident
                in centuries, the phoenix’s influence was of course still felt,
                but they had managed to control it in these new lands.<br /><br />

                thus, Fu Hua enjoyed a relatively normal childhood. Learning
                both from the Traditional Taixuan martial art, but as well as
                the secret art of the family, Fenghueng; - in other words the
                ability to use the Phoenix powers within them in case of
                emergency - she became rather skilled, and many saw in her a
                fitting successor for her father. As the tradition went, Fu Hua
                became the Empyrean (earning the name of “Azur Empyrean due to
                her belt) at the age of 18 and her father freed from the
                responsibilities of the Dojo, left to explore the world,
                becoming a pathfinder. <br />
                <br />

                Fu Hua would spend seven years in relative harmony (barring a
                few incidents), dedicating herself to the full mastery of the
                Taixuan while teaching the various students of the School...But
                of course, like everything, this era of peace would soon come to
                an end...<br /><br />

                One morning, news came to Fu Hua that her father had vanished
                during an expedition in Sal’ruin...And that the last reports of
                the city where he was stationed was that a great fire had
                erupted; leaving very few survivors; her father never returned
                from the inferno.<br />
                But whereas many of the officials assumed him dead, Fu Hua knows
                otherwise. Without much explanation, she left the Dojo in the
                hands of the other masters, and made her way to become a
                pathfinder. For such is the tragic duty of the Hua Clan - If her
                father has fallen prey to the Phoenix’s influence, she would
                have no choice but to take his life.

              <h4 class="cardChar_title">Personality</h4>
              <p class="cardChar_text">
                Fu Hua is very much the definition of someone who lives for their duty. Dedicated solely to her family, she works hard (sometimes too hard) for the future of her family; so much in fact that the idea of taking over her father's dojo was never truly a question, she never doubted nor desired another path. <br><br>
                That being said, this “no-nonsense” attitude has earned Fu Hua as many admirers as it earned her enmity. Generally ostracized from many of her peers, she spent, in fact, much of her time alone, practicing her martial art, or meditating to prevent the Phoenix’s influence from growing in her. Seen as unapproachable, even the disciples of the Dojo, while admiring their young teacher, would remain formal with her. <br><br>
                In the end, Fu Hua only has one “true” friend, in Lixue an advanced disciple of the Taixuan that she rescued from brigands in a trip with her father while younger. Fully dedicated to her savior, Lixue is highly protective of Fu Hua, and generally helps her with cooking and houseworking (which Fu Hua cannot handle herself).<br><br>
                Finally, Fu Hue’s drive for her duty, also leads her to be rather merciless. She is fully ready to slain her own father if he turns out to be corrupted; and if need be she is more than ready to kill herself; with no hesitation whatsoever, nor care for her own life. <br><br>

            <div class="tab-pane" id="settings">
              <h4 class="cardChar_title">Abilities - Part I : Taixuan</h4>
              <p class="cardChar_text">
                Fu Hua doesn’t have “Mana” nor any magic capabilities whatsoever. Instead, she relies on different sources of energy for her powers. As far as the Taixuan is concerned, it mostly relies on the body’s capabilities to build up energy. This energy is commonly called  <span>“Chi”</span>.<br><br>
                This “Chi” energy is manifested either through meditation sessions, or in situations of battle, where it naturally manifests itself. The Taixuan martial art learns to control and use this Chi. To do so, the Taixuan converts the Chi into two energy types known as “Yin” (Aka Dark energy) and “Yang” (aka light energy). These energies manifest with a black or white energy that can either envelop one body, be thrown towards opponents, or surround the martial artist fist as they battle.<br><br>
                Where “Yin” is mostly effective for attacks, “Yang” is effective to protect or enhance one’s body. As a result, the Taixuan teaches to remain in balance, as too much unbalance can have nefarious effects.<br><br>
                Provided that a martial artist manifest high level of both “Yin” and “Yang” and that both are in perfect balance, they can enter a state referred to as <span>eminence</span> where both energy are expanded at once in a singular technic made to end to end the fight.<br><br>
                The Taixuan provides an important weakness in its inability to perform at maximum potential from the start; and as a result the Taixuan  martial artists learn “Stances' ' that are meant to either build up their energies, or to spend these energies. Commonly a fight has the martial artist switch stances during the battle.<br><br>
              </p>
              <h5 class="cardChar_subtitle">In Game</h5>
              <p class="cardChar_text">The following are proposals about how Fu Hua’s abilities could work in game; it is here to give you ideas, if you have better ideas/balance things to do, there is no issue.<br><br>
                In Game, Fu Hua will begin battles with “0” of both of her energy bars (aka Yin and Yang); however if she has the time to prepare for battle,she can meditate and generate 1d6+3 per ten minutes spent meditating (with a maximum of 4d6+12, after that she would need hours to meditate). This energy can then be put as she wishes into either Yin or Yang.<br><br>
                Both “Yin” and “Yang'' will generate with every round at a rate of 2+1 per 1/2 level per round; Moreover, each time Fu Hua uses “Yin”, she will generate half of the energy spent (with a minimum of one) in “Yang” the opposite also works.<br><br>
                - For every 10 energy differences between Yin and Yang; Fu Hua gains benefits and negatives.<br> if she has more “Yin”, she loses 1 hp per 3 points of differences between it and Yang; every round. However, she gains 1 damage per 2 points of differences between it and Yang.<br><br>
                If she has more “Yang”, it is the opposite, she heals but does less damage.<br><br>
                - The Yin and Yang can be used for the following: <br>-<span>Yang</span> can augment her physical body, or heal herself and others. She can use it to jump much higher, run faster etc. <br><br>-<span>Yin</span> on the opposite can be used to debuff enemies or augment her strength, as well as add magic energy to her attacks.
                - Fu Hua has a maximum “Yin” and “Yang” equal to 30, she will gain 5 max energy per level. At any point after Fu Hua has more than half of her energy available and both her Yin and Yang are equal, she can enter a state of “Eminence” in which her energy “freezes” for 1d3 rounds with a minimum equal to her level. ; in which she is able to use her energies without gaining or losing any.<br><br>
                - Fu Hua has access to two stances; “Recovery” and “Assault” <br><br>- In her recovery Stance, Fu Hua is able to convert her Yin into Yang as a free Action, she also gains one extra energy per round. However, in recovery Stance, Fu Hua’s attack has a disadvantage to damage and hit.<br><br>- In her assault stance, Fu hua cannot convert more than 3+level energy per round as a free action. However, she gains a +1 damage per level to her attacks.
                </p>
                <h4 class="cardChar_title">Abilities - Part II : Fenghuang</h4>
                <p  class="cardChar_text">The Fenghuang is the most powerful ability of  “Fu Hua” however, it is extremely demanding and highly dangerous; This ability is distinguished between two variants.<br><br>

                    The first of these two abilities is the  <span>“Phoenix”</span> Variant.<br>
                    While it is certainly the most powerful ability of Fu Hua; it is a highly corruptive one, and one that risks her life just through its use. Once a day, Fu Hua can enter her “Fenghuang Form”; in which she gains 30 ki (+5 per level) and becomes able to use the Phoenix’s Fire. In this form, she has full control over a highly powerful and inextinguishable fire (requires magical water, not regular water). in this form, Fu Hua also gains an attack boost of +5, and her fire has a damage bonus of *1.5. However, Fu Hua loses 1/3 of her max HP per round, until she reaches zero. Upon reaching Zero, Fu Hua will automatically become cinder, and come back to life the next day as the sun rises; however there is a 5/100 (d100) chance that the Phoenix takes control of parts of her mind.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The Second ability, known as the <span>”Feathers of the Phoenix”</span> has Fu Hua use the Phoenix’s feather to either call upon its fire (Each feather is able to manifest one attack equal to 10ki, it also has the bonus of *1.5 to damage). Or to manifest other powerful abilities. She can, for instance, teleport to a feather that has the magic imbued within it, transfer part of her consciousness in a feather, or speak via telepathy with allies that have one of these feathers. These feathers can also manifest powerful illusions against Fu Hua’s foes; similarly to the ability to manifest fire, these feathers each have a power equivalent to Ten ki. 
                    While these feathers are powerful, Fu Hua only has 5+1 feather per level; the feathers reform themselves at a rate of 1 per week.

Lixue was originally a migrant from the Far South, but due to various circumstances, was separated from her family and nearly enslaved by a group of Brigands until Fu Hua and her father rescued her. Immediately attached to Fu Hua, she was taken in by the Taixuan Dojo and she trained along with Fu Hua, becoming her domestic, sole friend as well as personal disciple.<br><br>
                    Highly skilled with her sword (which she obtained shortly after being rescued by the Dojo), Lixue is the only disciple aware of the Fenghuang Truth, and she wishes to help Fu Hua and rescue her from the gruesome fate she is likely to encounter. It is for this very reason that Fu Hua didn’t warn her of her departure, unaware that Lixue is more than likely to follow.
